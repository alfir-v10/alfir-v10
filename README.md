### Hi there üëã
I am a post-graduate student of the Department of Radiophysics of Kazan Federal University.

At the moment, I am taking part in [School21](https://21-school.ru/) powered by [Sber](https://www.sberbank.ru/ru/person) and [42](https://www.42.fr/ledito/)


At school, I have to program in C, but in my free time, I like programming in Python.
